<h1>Mars</h1>

<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>Mars has become such an intriguing planet for us humankind. Mars lies right on the edge of the hapitable zone in our solar system, but yet there have been water found on the planet. Its widely accepted that where there is water, there is life, or at least the possibility of life to grow and prosper. There hasn't been water on the surface of Mars for years though, and even though there might have been life found on the Mars soil, it's been dead for thousands, maybe even millions of years. Don't quote me on any of this though, for I am still a pretty uneducated college student. But lets take all pre-concieved notions away and lets suppose that maybe humans can find a way to live on Mars. Even if it takes several years to just get to Mars, and that we somehow solve the problem of generating oxygen, fire, and water on Mars. Theoretically, Mars would be the safest place on the universe to live on, at least for a while. Assuming that water, oxygen, and food is taken care of, us human beings won't have any animals hunting us down since we would be the only beings on Mars. The climate on Mars is stable as far as I know, although its still much to cold. Assuming we found a way to heat Mars up, there would be no atmosphere to generate weather, and the interior of Mars is less active than Earth, so not many earthquakes or volcanoes. No atmosphere does mean that there is no impedence for asteroids, so we would have to develop a way to either dodge incoming asteroids, or redirect asteroids. But assuming all those issues are addressed, Mars ironically could be Eden for humankind. I say ironically because Mars was originally named after the Roman God of War, and to think that eventually Mars could become humankinds safest planet would indeed be ironic. Yet, humankind has proven itself over and over that peace doesn't last. Humankind has raged war after war after war upon itself, using precious resources and human lives for what I ask. Power? Money? Notoriety? It is widely agreed by scientists that eventually, we are going to have to colonize other planets because the way we use our planet now is leading us to an unsustainable doom. Our biggest problem in colonizing Mars and other planets, however, will not be terraforming them to meet our needs, but for us to learn and work together and live. With no external threat for humanity to fight against, what's going to protect humankind from turning on itself?</p>
